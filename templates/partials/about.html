                I'm a software developer with a story that's anything but linear - three careers, countless adventures,
                and an unquenchable curiosity that drives me to keep learning and building. My path has been less of a 
                straight line and more of an intricate web of experiences, each informing the next, always connected by
                a thread of creativity and problem-solving.

                My journey began behind a camera, spending my early years creating short films - learning early on how
                to transform raw material into compelling narratives. With a background in English Writing and Digital
                Cinema, I started my first career in videography writing scripts, shooting video, creating graphics,
                and editing videos. Those years taught me that great work is about seeing potential and knowing how to
                shape it. From manually rigging camera dollies to experimenting with lighting, I developed a hands-on
                approach to creation that would become my trademark.

                Banking became my unexpected second act, where I discovered I could apply my people skills and analytical
                thinking in entirely new ways. Rising from teller to Service Manager, I learned the art of solving complex
                problems, managing teams, and understanding intricate systems - skills that would prove invaluable when I
                transitioned into software development. In 2016, I made the leap into tech, springboarding my journey of
                learning at Prime Digital Academy where I dove headfirst into the world of full-stack development. My 
                learning style is pure trial by fire: give me a challenge, and I'll experiment, adapt, and master it.

                Today, after a decade in software development, I'm driven by a fundamental belief: technology is a powerful
                tool for connection and empowerment. Whether I'm working with APIs, exploring new programming languages,
                leveraging AI tools, or thinking about how software can make people's work more efficient, I'm motivated
                by the potential to create meaningful solutions. My diverse background isn't just a collection of careers
                - it's a toolkit of perspectives that allows me to approach technology with creativity, empathy, and an
                ever-present sense of wonder.

                I'm a passionate learner and adventure seeker who finds joy in the beautiful chaos
                of family life, creative pursuits, and endless curiosity. Whether I'm exploring a
                new hiking trail, tinkering with a woodworking project, or diving into an immersive
                video game with my two amazing boys, I'm always eager to embrace new experiences and
                challenges. My world revolves around my family - my wife and two sons who
                inspire me daily, along with our two wonderfully mischievous dogs who keep life
                interesting and full of unexpected moments.

                My approach to life is all about discovery and connection. From linux distro hopping
                to learning the intricacies of Dungeons & Dragons with my kids, I'm constantly seeking
                out new knowledge and skills. Photography captures my love for the outdoors, while
                writing allows me to explore the depths of creativity. I find equal excitement in the
                precision of woodworking, the thrill of a challenging bike ride, and the strategic
                depth of board games. Whether it's sharing a craft beer, engaging in a deep conversation,
                or enjoying a movie at the local theater, I believe life's richest moments come from
                genuine connections and continuous learning.
