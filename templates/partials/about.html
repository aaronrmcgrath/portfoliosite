            I'm a software developer that loves learning and solving problems. I graduated from Prime Digital Academy
            in Bloomington, MN in 2016. There I learned the MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js).
            I also worked with jQuery, Bootstrap, Angular-Material, PostgreSQL, Passport, and many other great technologies.

            My family is what makes me the happiest. I am a loving husband and proud father of two amazing boys.
            They always give me something to smile about. My hobbies are: hiking, gardening, video-games,
            cooking, movies/tv, comedy, writing, craft beer, board games, deep conversation, and discovery!
            I'm addicted to learning and love to explore.
